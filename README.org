* Dependency
This package depends on ~helm~ and please install beforehand.

* Usage

** helm-find-project-files
This command enables to find all files of the current working project.

It searches up the root directory having .git or .svn from the current buffer
and find all files regardless they are managed by Git or not by Linux find
command.

Therefore, even if they are not managed by the versioning system before you
commit, they show up on the helm interface and you can quickly open without any
cumbersome key operations.

** helm-find-project-files-ignored-paths
A list of file patterns to ignore with ~find~ command used internally.

The default value is '("*/.git/*" "*.elc").

If you would like to add exclude other patterns, you should add the new ones to this list.
For examples of my case, I would like to exclude compiled Python files ~*.pyc~ to be shown up
and it is good idea to extend this variable like this.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(add-to-list 'helm-find-project-files-exclude-paths "*/__pycache__*")
#+END_SRC

** helm-find-project-files-project-root-symbols
A list of symbols to be used to identify a root directory of a project.

If you put a special file ~.projectroot~ in a directory, it is identified as
project root directory besides .git and .svn.

* Motivation
I have used some well-known packages below to quickly find source files of the
working project, but I found some drawbacks and wanted others.  When I googled,
some guys also searched the similar feature and I decided to develop this and
disclose on public.

** helm-find-files, helm-find
They support to recursively find files only *under* the current working directory.
They don't find files of the working project managed by Git regardless of the
location of the current buffer.

I would like to get all of project files without depending on the current location.

** helm-projectile
This packages was awesome and enabled us to search the project files identified
by Git or a special file ~.projectile~ put on the project root etc.  However, I
encountered terrible performance on my Emacs one day and identified the package
caused it by just loading the package on my .emacs.

I searched the alternative and find some packages, but they didn't satisfied me
to use in daily development because I had to operate some keys to invoke the
function such as interaction and it annoyed me.
